## Installation

You need [Node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

If you cloned it from Github,
go into the appropriate directory on your device:

```sh
cd folder-name
```

and run it:

```sh
npm start
```

If you get some errors:

- check if you are in the correct folder (`name-of-the-kata`, not parent folder `kata`)
- check if you forgot something (e.g. `start` instead of `npm start`)
- check if you misspelled something (e.g `nmp strat` instead of `npm start`)
- check if you have Node & npm on your system (`node -v` and `npm -v` should show something like `v10.9.0 or 6.4.0`)
- read the error message & search for it in the www
- [contact me](#contact)
